# Problem 2

This zip file contains data from a longitudinal study that included a
control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is
included in a separate file, and file names include the subject ID and
arm.

### Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files
function will help

``` r
file_names <- data.frame(file_names=list.files(path = "./data", include.dirs = TRUE),
                         path_names=dir(path = "./data", full.names = TRUE))
```

Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using
purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe

``` r
file_data = function(path) {
  
  df = 
    read.csv(path) |>
    janitor::clean_names() 
  
  df
  
}


q2= 
  file_names |> 
  mutate(observations = purrr::map(path_names, file_data))

unnested_q2<-unnest(q2, cols = observations)
```

Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and
subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other
tidying that’s necessary

``` r
long_q2<-unnested_q2 %>% 
    pivot_longer(
      week_1:week_8,
      names_to = "week", 
      values_to = "observations",
      names_prefix = "week_") %>% 
  separate(file_names, into = c("arm", "subject"), sep = "_") %>% 
  mutate(subject=str_replace(subject, ".csv","")) %>% 
  select(!path_names) 
```

Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time

``` r
q2_spaghetti<-
  long_q2 %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=as.numeric(week), y=as.numeric(observations),color=subject))+
  geom_line()+ 
  facet_grid(~arm)+
  labs(
    title = "Observations for each subject by week",
    x = "Week",
    y = "Observations",
    color = "Subject")

#changed the week and observations to numeric

q2_spaghetti
```

### comment on differences between groups

The control arm does not appear to change while there is a positive
slope for the experimental arm.

# Problem 3

When designing an experiment or analysis, a common question is whether
it is likely that a true effect will be detected – put differently,
whether a false null hypothesis will be rejected. The probability that a
false null hypothesis is rejected is referred to as power, and it
depends on several factors, including: the sample size; the effect size;
and the error variance. In this problem, you will conduct a simulation
to explore power in a one-sample t-test.

First set the following design elements:

Fix n=30 Fix σ=5 Set μ=0 . Generate 5000 datasets from the model

x∼Normal\[μ,σ\]

``` r
sim_mean_sd <- function(n, mu = 0, sigma = 5) {
  
  sim_data <- tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  )
  
  t_test_results <- t.test(sim_data$x, mu = 0) %>%
    broom::tidy() %>%
    select(p.value)
  
  mu_hat <- sim_data %>%
    summarize(mu_hat = mean(x))
  
  return(data.frame(mu_hat = mu_hat$mu_hat, p_value = t_test_results$p.value))
}
```

``` r
sim_results_df = 
  expand_grid(
    sample_size = 30,
    iter = 1:5000
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    estimate_df = map(sample_size, sim_mean_sd)
  ) |> 
  unnest(estimate_df) |>
  select(mu_hat, p_value)
```

For each dataset, save μ^ and the p-value arising from a test of H:μ=0
using α=0.05 . Hint: to obtain the estimate and p-value, use broom::tidy
to clean the output of t.test.

Repeat the above for μ={1,2,3,4,5,6} , and complete the following:

Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected (the
power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis.
Describe the association between effect size and power.

Make a plot showing the average estimate of μ^ on the y axis and the
true value of μ on the x axis.

Make a second plot (or overlay on the first) the average estimate of μ^
only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y axis and the
true value of μ on the x axis. Is the sample average of μ^ across tests
for which the null is rejected approximately equal to the true value of
μ ? Why or why not?
